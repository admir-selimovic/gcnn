# Geometric Complex Neural Networks (GCNN)

## Overview

Geometric Complex Neural Networks (GCNN) are designed for advanced geometric representation learning. The model operates on geometrically realized cell complexes with geometric features and maintains equivariance under $\mathrm{E}(3)$ group transformations.

### Key Feature: Geometric Message Passing Mechanism for Geometric Quantities

One of the defining aspects of GCNN is its **Geometric Message Passing Mechanism**, explicitly engineered to work with geometric quantities and information. The mechanism enables the diffusion of geometric information throughout the network, thereby facilitating higher-order representation learning on cell complexes. It utilizes the algebraic topology of non-dyadic and trans-hierarchical interactions to significantly enhance the model's learning capabilities in geometrically rich environments.

### Highlights

- Utilizes topological and geometric structures inherent to cell complexes for higher expressivity.
- Equivariat with respect to $E(3)$ group transformations.
- Overcomes the limitations of scalar feature fields by incorporating harmonic feature fields.
- Exploits topological and geometric structure of cell complexes for higher expressivity.

## Introduction

Representation of geometric quantities in neural networks presents a unique computational challenge due to their sensitivity to spatial symmetries. The GCNN model, rooted in group theory, representation theory, and algebraic topology, aims to tackle this challenge by adapting to the unique symmetries of progressively complex group spaces.

## Features

### Equivariance

One of the key features of GCNN is its equivariat architecture. The model captures features that are invariant under rotational, orientational, translational, and reflective symmetries. This enables the model to generalize well across different orientations and configurations.

### Directable Features

GCNN is designed to accept scalar, vector, and tensor fields over $\mathbb{R}^3$ as input and output. This ensures that the model can learn and represent geometric quantities on cell complexes effectively.

### Rich Topological and Geometric Structures

Unlike traditional graph neural networks, GCNN exploits the rich topological and geometric structure of the cell complex for more expressive representation learning. This offers a more robust framework compared to traditional graph-based approaches.
